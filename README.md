# Code quality

To ensure the code quality, I used Eslint, Typescript and prettie.

I found out about Vite and I wanted to have a boilerplate for the technologies that I use. You can find more about these in the following links: [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

# Themeing & styling

For Themeing & styling, I used MUI theme an sass. Light/Dark mode is created.

# UI|UX

Loading Skelton and to indicate waiting the server data.

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `yarn install`

or Run command

```
npx degit TheSwordBreaker/vite-reactts-eslint-prettier project-name
```

## Start

After the successfull installation of the packages: `yarn dev`

## Steps in Vscode

#### (works with better with this template)

1. Install Eslint and prettier extension for vs code.
2. Make Sure Both are enabled
3. Make sure all packages are Installed. (Mostly Eslint and prettier in node_modules)
4. Enable formatOnSave of vs code
5. Open a .tsx file and check if the bottom right corners of vs code have Eslint and Prettier with a double tick
